# Youtube-playlistDownloader

The YouTube Playlist Downloader is a Python application that allows users to download entire playlists from YouTube by simply providing the playlist URL. It utilizes the powerful yt_dlp library, which is an enhanced fork of youtube-dl. This project enables users to select their preferred video quality (ranging from 360p to the best available resolution) and download all videos from the playlist in one go. The downloaded videos are automatically organized in folders, named according to the playlist and video titles.

How It Works:

The program asks for a YouTube playlist URL.
It then presents the user with a list of available video quality options and prompts the user to choose one.
Based on the userâ€™s input, it sets up the yt_dlp options to download the playlist in the selected quality.
The program organizes the download into a folder named after the playlist, saving each video with the title of the video.
After the download is complete, a success message is displayed.
This project is perfect for users who need to download a YouTube playlist quickly and efficiently while having control over the video quality of the downloads.
